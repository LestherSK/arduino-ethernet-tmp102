arduino-ethernet-tmp102
========================

arduino ethernet reading temperature and uploading on exosite

uses i2c bitbanging to read a tmp102 temperature sensor

I've used http://ed.am/dev/make/arduino-mk to work outside the Arduino IDE, just using vim and make

The tmp102 is connected to pins 6 (SDA) and 7 (SCL) of the Arduino ethernet board.
